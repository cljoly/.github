## Reporting a Vulnerability

First, thanks for considering reporting!

You can [contact me][contact] and encrypt your message with one of the [keys][].
Please describe the issue as precisely as possible and don’t hesitate to propose a fix (for instance, with a [patch sent over email][sendmail]) if you have one.

<!-- Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability. -->

<!-- Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a -->
<!-- reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or -->
<!-- declined, etc. -->

## Dependencies

As much as possible, I limit the number of dependencies used in my projects. Please avoid introducing new dependencies in your PRs if possible. The fewer dependencies, the better. The dependencies actually included should be relatively popular and from trusted authors, as I can’t audit any of them.

## Disclaimer

This policy is not a guarantee that my software will have the desired behavior or won’t cause harm. Please refer to the License of each software for the full disclaimer.
