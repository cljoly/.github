## Reporting a Vulnerability

First, thanks for considering reporting!

You can [contact me][contact] and encrypt your message with one of the [keys][].
Please describe the issue as precisely as possible and don’t hesitate to propose a fix (for instance, with a [patch sent over email][sendmail]) if you have one.

<!-- Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability. -->

<!-- Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a -->
<!-- reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or -->
<!-- declined, etc. -->
