Thanks for considering contributing!

To keep things simple, [my projects](https://cj.rs/open-source) all follow these common guidelines.

## TL;DR

If you just want to fix a typo or another very small thing, just create a PR.

## Documentation

As the author of a tool or library, we are blind to many of the problems that users may encounter. So as an external person, you have the power to spot this! Feel free to open an issue or send a PR with proposed changes we can start from there.

## Code

* It is advisable to create an issue to discuss the feature you want to add, so that you can make sure it has good chances to be merged. This also avoids having multiple persons working on the same thing.
* If you don’t know what to do, but still want to help, that’s great! Look for issues labeled [`good-first-issue`][gh-first] or [`help-wanted`][gh-help]. You can also [contact me](https://cj.rs/contact), and tell me about your interests and skills.

## Code of Conduct

To foster a welcoming environment, we also follow [a code of conduct](https://cj.rs/docs/code-of-conduct/).
